# Monster-Chase
This is the final project I had to make for my A.I. class in college. Took me sometime and still working on it bit by bit.
You have control as the player who needs to get all of the yellow "coins" on the screen and avoid the "monster" chasing you. 

You are the red square, the monster is the green one.
